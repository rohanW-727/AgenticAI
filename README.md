# AgenticAI

## Overview
Worked as Core AI Architect on a private project repository for UMD ACM’s Agentic AI system — a multi-tool LLM-driven agent framework enabling structured tool execution via chained LLM calls.

## My Responsibilities
- Contributed to system-level design discussions for a pre-existing agent execution loop developed by the project lead.
- Designed and implemented a short-term memory component for storing and retrieving recent queries and intermediate reasoning state.
- Integrated memory retrieval into the agent’s existing decision pipeline without modifying core execution semantics.


## Achievements
- Developed a short term memory component in early builds of the system that allowed for easy storage and retrieval of past queries. 
- Benchmarked latency of system with and without short term memory component resulting in ~20% reduction in latency with the short term memory component integrated.
